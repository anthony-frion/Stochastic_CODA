# stochastic_CODA

This project studies stochastic extensions of the original (deterministic) CODA model:

Zinchenko, Vadim, and David S. Greenberg. "Combined Optimization of Dynamics and Assimilation with End-to-End Learning on Sparse Observations." arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.07137 (2024).

The code is based on the one from this original work, which is available here: https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/m-dml/hidden-process-learning

Some preliminary ideas and formalisations for this new project can be found here: https://www.overleaf.com/read/bthkqjvpybmd#fa002b
